# Catering App

## Mission
### The current ordering process for catering service and the way any meaningful data is extracted from the log sheets is inefficient and cumbersome. 
### For the Facilities Team to create a proper budget, plan for the upcoming year, and deliver catering services in a timely and efficient manner the burden of any solution would be to digitize the process and make extracting analytics automatic.
### For that reason, the Toronto Dshop Team along with the Toronto Facilities Team have come together to create the SAP Catering App which truly digitizes the process of ordering a catering service and extracting meaningful data, all while keeping a strong focus in User Experience.
